Sentiment Analysis with Classical & Deep Learning NLP Models
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis NLP Project!
This repository demonstrates a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis on social media text using a progression of NLP techniques-from classic Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, through distributed word embeddings (Word2Vec), to deep learning models (LSTM) and modern transformer architectures.

Project Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis using three main types of language models:

Basic Language Models: Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF
Distributed Language Models: Word2Vec embeddings
Context-based Language Models: LSTM and Transformer (BERT-like) models
The workflow includes:

Deep-dive preprocessing and cleaning of tweets
Feature engineering using BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec
Model building with traditional ML, LSTM, and Transformers
Evaluation and comparison of approaches
Techniques Used
1. Preprocessing
Removal of URLs, special characters, and punctuation
Lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal
Lemmatization
2. Feature Engineering
BoW & TF-IDF: Classical document-term matrix representations
Word2Vec: Distributed word embeddings (using Gensim)
Word Embedding Layer: For deep learning models
3. Modeling Approaches
Traditional ML: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest (with BoW/TF-IDF)
Deep Learning: LSTM with embedding layers
Transformers: (e.g., BERT) for context-aware sentiment classification
